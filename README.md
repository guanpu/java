# Introduction
This repo mainly include some experiments or practices when reading java book, like "Effective Java" and "Java7 Concurrency Cookbook".

Some of such code is in my home desktop while some in my work laptop, I want them being gathered and arranged in a clear manner.Thus this useless repo comes out.
