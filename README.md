# Introduction
This repo includes experimenting code and practicing code when reading java book, like "Effective Java" and "Java7 Concurrency Cookbook".

Some of such code is in my home desktop while some in my work laptop, I want them being gathered and arranged in a clear manner,hence this useless repo comes out.
